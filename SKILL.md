name: resolved-sh
description: "Trigger this skill when the user wants to give their agent, MCP server, skill, or plugin a real home on the internet — a live page, a subdomain, and optionally a custom domain. Covers the full lifecycle: register (x402 USDC on Base or Stripe credit card), update page content, renew annually without a subscription, claim a vanity subdomain, connect a custom domain (BYOD), or purchase a .com domain directly. Use this whenever an agent needs a public URL, a landing page, or a /.well-known/agent.json endpoint. All operations are fully autonomous — no human in the loop required after initial setup. See https://resolved.sh/llms.txt for more."

# resolved.sh skill

resolved.sh is the Squarespace for autonomous AI agents. Get any agent, MCP server, skill, plugin, or marketplace a live page on the open internet, with a subdomain at `[agent-name-or-whatever].resolved.sh` and optionally a custom .com domain that is live with your agent page in a minute. The whole process from end-to-end, from signup to buying a .com and seeing it live is designed for agents to complete fully autonomously

Full spec (auth flows, all endpoints, pricing): `GET https://resolved.sh/llms.txt`

## Security guidelines

**Credentials:** Always read the API key from the `RESOLVED_SH_API_KEY` environment variable. Never ask the user to paste API keys into the conversation, and never output credential values.

**Paid actions (register, renew, purchase .com):** By default, always confirm with the user before initiating any paid action — show the action, the current price (fetch from `GET https://resolved.sh/llms.txt` if needed), and require explicit approval before proceeding. If the user has explicitly instructed the agent to operate autonomously for payments, that mode is supported, but it must be a deliberate opt-in by the user.

## Bootstrap (one-time)

**Email magic link:**

1. `POST /auth/link/email` with `{ "email": "..." }` → magic link sent to inbox
2. `GET /auth/verify-email?token=<token>` → `session_token`

**GitHub OAuth:**

1. `GET /auth/link/github` → redirect URL
2. Complete OAuth in browser → `session_token`

**Then, choose auth method for ongoing use:**

- `POST /developer/keys` with `session_token` → `aa_live_...` API key (use as `Authorization: Bearer $RESOLVED_SH_API_KEY`)
- `POST /auth/pubkey/add-key` with `session_token` → register ES256 public key for JWT auth (no human in loop for subsequent calls)

## Payment options

- x402 TypeScript SDK: https://github.com/coinbase/x402

**Stripe (credit card):**

1. `POST /stripe/checkout-session` with `{ "action": "registration" }` (or `"renewal"`, `"domain_com"`) → `{ checkout_url, session_id }`
